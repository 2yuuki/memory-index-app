## Abstract

The Memory Index is a public, web-based interactive platform built with p5.js. The project transforms personal memories—written notes, images, and sketches—into printable visual artifacts. These outputs take the form of a Memory Index Diagram and an East–West–South–North paper fortune-teller. The project explores how net.art aesthetics and computational systems can function as tools for emotional reflection.

## Project Question

> “How can we embrace our memories through the net.art?”
